You will also be able to seamlesslly interact with EBRAINS tools for the creation and fruition of neural models through the available services.<br><br>",

In order to actively use these resources in a model building workflow, we integrated our pages with the EBRAINS Hodgking Huxley Neuron Builder (HHNB) tool, which allow to optimize a single cell NEURON model against electrophysiological data and run it on a dedicated simulation environment, the EBRAINS BlueNaas (NEURON As A Service). Start exploring the Hippocampus portal in order to take advantage of this functionality or direct access the HHNB webapp by clicking on the button below."
